# Ultrasonic Sensor and LCD to display the distance for ESP32_S1
This project demonstrates how to use an ESP32 microcontroller to measure the distance to an object using an ultrasonic sensor and display the measured distance on a 16x2 LCD. The project is designed to showcase how microcontrollers can interface with sensors and output devices to provide real-time data visualization.


**Components:**
- ESP32_S1
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- LCD 16x4

**Simulation:**

Wokwi Website.


The code includes functions to send commands and data to the LCD, initialize the LCD, and print strings to the LCD.
The main loop continuously measures the distance and updates the LCD with the latest reading.

The project provides immediate visual feedback on the distance to an object, which can be useful for debugging and testing in various applications.
By completing this project, users will gain hands-on experience in interfacing an ESP32 with an ultrasonic sensor and an LCD, enhancing their understanding of embedded systems and real-time data display.
